Insights from trend analysis:

SQL remains consistently the most requested skill throughout the year

Python shows steady growth, indicating rising technical expectations

Excel demand fluctuates but remains persistently high

Power BI shows a clear upward trend, especially toward year-end

Tableau demand remains stable but secondary

➡️ Indian analyst roles are slowly evolving toward technical depth while retaining strong business orientation.

3️⃣ Salary Distribution Across Data Roles (India)

Insights from salary box plots:

Machine Learning Engineers and Data Engineers earn significantly more than Data Analysts

Data Analyst salaries show lower variance, indicating standardized pay bands

Senior roles increase salary, but extreme outliers are rare compared to US markets

Software Engineers overlap with data roles but show narrower salary spread

➡️ In India, role specialization matters more than tool count for salary growth.

4️⃣ Highest-Paid Skills for Data Analysts in India

Insights from highest-paid skills analysis:

Specialized tools like dplyr, GitLab, Bitbucket, Solidity, Hugging Face command very high median salaries

These skills appear less frequently but are linked to premium niche roles

Infrastructure and platform tools (Cassandra, Couchbase, VMware) also show strong pay

➡️ High salary in India is driven by specialization, not popularity.
