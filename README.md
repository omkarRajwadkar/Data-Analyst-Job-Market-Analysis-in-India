📊 Data Analyst Job Market Analysis — India 🇮🇳
📌 Overview
This project analyzes the Indian Data Analyst job market to understand skill demand, salary trends, and optimal skill combinations for aspiring and early-career data professionals.

While inspired by Luke Barousse’s analytical methodology, the analysis, filtering, visualizations, and insights are entirely focused on India, leading to market-specific conclusions that differ significantly from US-based studies.

🎯 Objectives
This project answers four key questions for the Indian job market:

What skills are most in demand for Data Analysts in India?

How are core Data Analyst skills trending over time?

How do salaries compare across data roles in India?

Which skills are most optimal to learn (high demand + high pay)?

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python – Primary programming language

Pandas – Data cleaning & transformation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis workflow

VS Code – Script execution

Git & GitHub – Version control & documentation


🧹 Data Preparation
Converted posting dates for time-series analysis

Parsed skill lists into structured formats

Filtered India-based job postings only

Removed missing and invalid salary records

Standardized job titles for accurate comparison

🔍 Key Insights (India-Specific)
1️⃣ Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in India
Python and SQL dominate Indian Data Analyst job postings

Excel and PowerPoint remain highly relevant, reflecting business-heavy analyst roles

Power BI demand is strong, often exceeding Tableau in Indian postings

Traditional tools like Word and SAS still appear, unlike in US-focused analyses

📌 Key Takeaway: India places a stronger emphasis on business reporting and tooling compared to pure analytics.

2️⃣ Trending Skills for Data Analysts (India)
SQL remains consistently the most requested skill throughout the year

Python shows steady growth, indicating increasing technical expectations

Excel demand fluctuates but remains persistently high

Power BI shows a clear upward trend, especially towards year-end

Tableau demand remains stable but secondary

📌 Key Takeaway: Indian analyst roles are evolving slowly toward technical depth while retaining strong business orientation.

3️⃣ Salary Distribution of Data Roles in India
Machine Learning Engineers and Data Engineers earn significantly more than Data Analysts

Data Analyst salaries show lower variance, indicating standardized compensation bands

Senior roles increase pay, but extreme outliers are rare compared to US markets

Software Engineers overlap with Data roles but show less salary spread

📌 Key Takeaway: In India, specialization and role type matter more than tool count for salary growth.

4️⃣ Highest-Paid Skills for Data Analysts (India)
Niche and specialized tools like dplyr, GitLab, Bitbucket, Solidity, Hugging Face command very high median salaries

These skills appear less frequently but indicate premium, specialized roles

Infrastructure and data-platform skills (Cassandra, Couchbase, VMware) also pay well

📌 Key Takeaway: High pay in India is driven by specialization, not popularity.

5️⃣ Most Optimal Skills to Learn (High Demand + High Pay)
Python → Best balance of demand and salary

SQL → Mandatory foundation skill

Power BI → High demand with solid salary outcomes

Tableau → Valuable but slightly less dominant than Power BI

SQL Server / Databases → Niche but strong salary upside

📌 Key Takeaway: The optimal Indian Data Analyst stack blends business tools with technical depth.

📚 What I Learned
Indian job markets prioritize business impact over pure analytics

Skill demand varies significantly by geography

Visualization clarity directly impacts insight quality

Salary optimization requires strategic specialization, not just popular tools

⚠️ Challenges Faced
Handling missing and inconsistent salary data

Normalizing diverse skill naming conventions

Designing readable visualizations for dense datasets

Balancing depth of analysis with project scope
